        Leave that to me. I know my business.<br> Thank Heaven! this is not
        the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; <br>and I wish
        I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged.
    </p>

    <h4 class="name HAR">HAR.</h4>
    
    <p class="speech ">
        Every magistrate must take this affair in hand;<br> and if my money
        is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself.
    </p>
    <h4 class="name OFF">OFF.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">
        We must take all needful steps. You say there was in that
        casket...?

    <h4 class="name HAR">HAR.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">
        Ten thousand crowns in cash.

    <h4 class="name HAR">HAR.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">Ten thousand crowns.</p>
    <h4 class="name OFF">OFF.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">A considerable theft.</p>
    <H4 class="name HAR">HAR.</H4>
    <P class="speech ">There is no punishment great enough for the enormity of the
        crime;<br>b and if it remain unpunished, the most sacred things are no
        longer secure.
    </P>
    <h4 class="name OFF">OFF.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">You must not, if you trust me, frighten anybody, but must use
        gentle means to collect evidence,<br> in order afterwards to proceed with
        more rigour<br> for the recovery of the sum which has been taken from you.</p>
   <h4 class="name JAC">JAC.</h4>
   <p class="speech ">
     (_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
    came in_).<br> I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
    feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.
   </p>
   <h4 class=" name HAR">HAR.</h4>
   <p class="speech ">
    HAR. What! Him who has robbed me?
   </p>
   <h4 class="name JAC">JAC.</h4>
   <p class="speech ">
    JAC. I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
    me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.
   </p>

     <h4 class="name HAR"> OFF.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">
        This is no longer the question; and you have to speak of
something else to this gentleman.
    </p>
    <h4 class="name OFF">OFF.</h4>
    <p class="speech ">You must, in this case, my good man, hide nothing from your
        master.</p>
