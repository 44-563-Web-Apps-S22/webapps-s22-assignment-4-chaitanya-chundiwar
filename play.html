    <h3>
        SCENE I.
        <br>
        <span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">--HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER.</span>
    </h3>
    <b>OFF.</b>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not
        the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish
        I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged.
    </p>
<br>
    <b>HAR.</b>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money
        is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself.
    </p>
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE II.<br>
    <span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.</span>

<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    (_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
    came in_). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
    feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.
</p>
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    What! Him who has robbed me?
</p>
<br>
<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE III.<br>
    <span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
        --HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES.
    </span>
</h3>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most
horrible crime, that was ever committed.
</p>
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I
have done nor will I try to palliate it.
</p>
<br>
<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    (_aside_). Oh! oh! Have I guessed the truth?
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE IV.
    <br>
<span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
    --HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES,
THE POLICE OFFICER.
</span>
</h3>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Ah! guilty daughter! unworthy of a father like me! is it thus
that you put into practice the lessons I have given you? You give your
love to an infamous thief, and engage yourself to him without my
consent! But you shall both be disappointed. (_To_ ÉLISE) Four strong
walls will answer for your conduct in the future; (_to_ VALÈRE) and
good gallows, impudent thief, shall do me justice for your audacity.
</p>
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Your anger will be no judge in this affair, and I shall at least
have a hearing before I am condemned.
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE V.
    <br>
    <span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">--ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE
        POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.
    </span>
</h3>
<br>
<b>ANS.</b> 
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon? You are quite upset.
</p>
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and
you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the
contract you have come to sign! I am attacked in my property; I am
attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who
has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into
my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my
daughter.
</p>
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Who ever thought of your money about which you rave?
</p>
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE VI.
    <br>
    <span style="color: aqua; font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
        --HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE,
FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE.

</h3>
<br>
<b>CLE.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have
news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me
marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you.
</p>
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Where is it?
</p>
<br>
<b>CLE.</b>
<br>
<p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
    Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I
answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to
decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your
cash-box.
