        The Miser 
    </h2>
    <h3>
        SCENE I.--HARPAGON, A POLICE OFFICER.
    </h3>
    <b>OFF.</b>
    <br>
    Leave that to me. I know my business. Thank Heaven! this is not
the first time I have been employed in finding out thieves; and I wish
I had as many bags of a thousand francs as I have had people hanged.
<br>
    <b>HAR.</b>
    <br>
    Every magistrate must take this affair in hand; and if my money
is not found, I shall call justice against justice itself.
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE II.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.
</h3>
<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
(_at the end of the stage, turning back to the door by which he
came in_). I am coming back. Have his throat cut at once; have his
feet singed; put him in boiling water, and hang him up to the ceiling.
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
What! Him who has robbed me?
<br>
<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
I was speaking of a sucking pig that your steward has just sent
me; and I want to have it dressed for you after my own fancy.
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE III.--HARPAGON, THE POLICE OFFICER, VALÈRE, MASTER JACQUES.
</h3>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
Come, come near, and confess the most abominable action, the most
horrible crime, that was ever committed.
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
Sir, since everything is known to you, I will neither deny what I
have done nor will I try to palliate it.
<br>
<b>JAC.</b>
<br>
(_aside_). Oh! oh! Have I guessed the truth?
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE IV.--HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, VALÈRE, FROSINE, MASTER JACQUES,
THE POLICE OFFICER.
</h3>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
Ah! guilty daughter! unworthy of a father like me! is it thus
that you put into practice the lessons I have given you? You give your
love to an infamous thief, and engage yourself to him without my
consent! But you shall both be disappointed. (_To_ ÉLISE) Four strong
walls will answer for your conduct in the future; (_to_ VALÈRE) and
good gallows, impudent thief, shall do me justice for your audacity.
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
Your anger will be no judge in this affair, and I shall at least
have a hearing before I am condemned.
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE V.--ANSELME, HARPAGON, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, FROSINE, VALÈRE, THE
    POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES.
</h3>
<br>
<b>ANS.</b>
<br>
What can have happened, Mr. Harpagon? You are quite upset.
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
Ah, Mr. Anselme, you see in me the most unfortunate of men; and
you can never imagine what vexation and disorder is connected with the
contract you have come to sign! I am attacked in my property; I am
attacked in my honour; and you see there a scoundrel and a wretch who
has violated the most sacred rights, who has introduced himself into
my house as a servant in order to steal my money, and seduce my
daughter.
<br>
<b>VAL.</b>
<br>
Who ever thought of your money about which you rave?
<br>
<h3>
    SCENE VI.--HARPAGON, ANSELME, ÉLISE, MARIANNE, CLÉANTE, VALÈRE,
FROSINE, THE POLICE OFFICER, MASTER JACQUES, LA FLÈCHE.
</h3>
<br>
<b>CLE.</b>
<br>
Do not grieve for your money, father, and accuse any one. I have
news of it, and I come here to tell you that if you consent to let me
marry Marianne, your money will be given back to you.
<br>
<b>HAR.</b>
<br>
Where is it?
<br>
<b>CLE.</b>
<br>
Do not trouble yourself about that. It is in a safe place, and I
answer for it; everything depends on your resolve. It is for you to
decide, and you have the choice either of losing Marianne or your
cash-box.
